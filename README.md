# nev
Natural language evaluation for proof problems.

## Usage

We need to create a config file for OpenAI API key before using nev. It is named `.apiconfig.json` at the root folder, which should include two elements as follows:

```json
{
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-xxx",
    "OPENAI_BASE_URL": "https://xxx.xx/v1"
}
```

You should replace the contents with your own API key and base url.
